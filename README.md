# Oscar Strachan's Portfolio Website
![Preview image](preview.png?raw=true "Optional Title")
My portfolio website designed to showcase my technical skills and relevant experience for prospective employers. 
I developed the website using HTML &amp; CSS - specifically using the CSS BEM methodology for modularity and easy maintenance.
Making the website responsive on other resolutions was particularly tedious but ultimately rewarding. 
I don't necessarily plan to add any particularly large features moving forward, but I do plan to consistently maintain the website with up-to-date information.
